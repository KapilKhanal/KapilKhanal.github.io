**[Sridhar Mahadevan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sridhar-Mahadevan-6), Fellow of AAAI says in one of the Quora post,

>  Do yourself a favor, and pull back, at least a little. Don’t spend every waking hour hacking TensorFlow or PyTorch, no matter how tempting these may be. Learn AI! Understand the large number of subfields, and what people in these subfields do. ***Read the classic papers*****. Understand the “frame problem”, what is the “no-free-lunch “ theorem in ML, what “behavior-based robotics” is all about, what the major issues in natural language processing are, what “random projections” are, and so on. There is an ocean of work in AI that is not DL, and it is every bit as exciting as DL is. And then, yes, if you must, certainly learn TF or PT. :-)
